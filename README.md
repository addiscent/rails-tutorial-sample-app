# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

This web site is a work in progress.  It is unfinished
at this time.  The current state of the web site can be seen at:

This web site may need up to thirty seconds to wake up and
be displayed, as it is hosted on one of Heroku's generous free
accounts, which frequently sleep in order to reduce costs.
