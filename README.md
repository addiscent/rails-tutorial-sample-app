# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

The tutorial web site is a work in progress.  It is unfinished
at this time.  The current state of the web site can be seen at:

  https://limitless-headland-4571.herokuapp.com/

The web site may need up to thirty seconds to be displayed,
(if it hasn't been visited recently), as it is hosted on one
of Heroku's generous free accounts.
